A full-stack MERN application that lets users explore, manage, and organize movies with genre filters, ratings, authentication, and a personal Watch Later list.

This project demonstrates my ability to build and integrate a React frontend, Node/Express backend, and MongoDB database with authentication, API integration, and responsive UI.
